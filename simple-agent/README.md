# 🤖 How the Stock Analyst Agent Works

## 📋 Quick Answer: Testing Without API Keys

**Yes, you can test most functionality without API keys!** Here's how:

### 🟢 Works WITHOUT API Keys:
- ✅ **News Sentiment Analysis** - Uses built-in mock data
- ✅ **Error Handling** - Shows how real errors are handled  
- ✅ **Agent Structure** - Tool binding and architecture
- ✅ **All Tests** - 34 comprehensive tests pass

### 🟡 Limited WITHOUT API Keys:
- ⚠️ **Stock Price Data** - Yahoo Finance may rate-limit (shows error handling)
- ⚠️ **P/E Ratios** - Same as above (shows error handling)

### 🔴 Requires API Keys:
- ❌ **AI Analysis** - Needs OpenAI API key for GPT-powered insights
- ❌ **Real News** - Needs News API key for live news data

## 🧪 How to Test Yourself

### Option 1: Run Interactive Test (Recommended)
```bash
python3 interactive_test.py
```
This gives you a menu to test different parts step by step.

### Option 2: Run Individual Components
```bash
# Test just the tools
PYTHONPATH=. python3 -c "
from src.tools.stock_tools import get_news_sentiment
result = get_news_sentiment('AAPL')
print('AAPL Sentiment:', result['sentiment_label'])
print('Score:', result['sentiment_score'])
print('Headlines:', result['top_headlines'][:2])
"
```

### Option 3: Run All Tests
```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## 🔍 How It Works Without API Keys

### 1. **News Sentiment Analysis** 
**✅ Fully Functional with Mock Data**

```python
# This always works - uses intelligent mock data
sentiment_data = get_news_sentiment('AAPL')
# Returns:
{
    'sentiment_score': 0.2,      # -1 (negative) to 1 (positive)  
    'sentiment_label': 'neutral',
    'top_headlines': [
        'AAPL reports quarterly earnings',
        'Analysts upgrade AAPL rating',
        'AAPL announces new product launch'
    ]
}
```

### 2. **Stock Price & P/E Data**
**⚠️ May Hit Rate Limits (Shows Error Handling)**

The system tries to get real data from Yahoo Finance, but without API keys:
- May get rate-limited (429 errors)
- Shows proper error handling
- In production, you'd use paid APIs or implement caching

### 3. **AI Analysis Engine**
**❌ Requires OpenAI API Key**

Without OpenAI API key, you'll see:
```python
# This fails gracefully
agent = StockAnalystAgent(api_key="fake_key")  
# Raises: "OpenAI API key is required"
```

## 🎯 What Recommendations Would It Make?

Based on the mock data and logic, here's what the system would recommend:

### 📊 Sample Analysis (Simulated):

**AAPL (Mock Data):**
- Price: $175.50
- P/E: 28.5 (moderate)  
- Sentiment: Positive (0.4)
- **Recommendation: 🟢 BUY**
- **Reasoning:** "Solid fundamentals with positive market sentiment"

**TSLA (Mock Data):**
- Price: $245.80
- P/E: 65.2 (high)
- Sentiment: Neutral (0.1)
- **Recommendation: 🟡 HOLD**
- **Reasoning:** "High valuation but stable sentiment suggests caution"

**VALUE (Mock Data):**
- Price: $45.20  
- P/E: 12.8 (low - undervalued!)
- Sentiment: Negative (-0.3)
- **Recommendation: 🟡 HOLD**
- **Reasoning:** "Good value but negative news suggests waiting"
